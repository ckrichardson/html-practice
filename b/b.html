      <p>This is an example of the <code>&lt;b&gt;</b></code> HTML element</p>
      <p>Previously it was known as the Boldface element where the browser would render the encapsulated content as Bold</p>
      <p>However, now it is not recommended to use this element to specify Boldface</p>
      <p>Instead, use the <b id="font-weight">font-weight</b> attribute to style and create bold text</p>
